<!-- This is **Introduction**, a minimalist website theme made for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). -->

I initially began my journey as a biology major at Utah State University. I was a lab assistant working on identifying PD-L1 in bovine placentas. I love research and the intersection between biological systems and technology. After publishing a paper on my research, I decided that computer science was more applicable to my skills. After making the switch, I've worked on different software across different fields. I've worked with GIS software, healthcare systems, and space defense projects. I love to program and solve any challenge.
