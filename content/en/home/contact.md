<!-- In the Contact section of **Introduction**, you may optionally display the current time in your preferred timezone. -->

You can reach out to me (below) **Email** is the best way to contact me. I'm always interested in discussing ideas, brainstorming new projects, and freelance work. 

<!-- This lets visitors know what sort of response time to expect when they contact you. The timezone is easily set in the `config.toml` file. See the exampleSite configuration for instructions. -->
